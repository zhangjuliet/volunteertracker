# Volunteer Tracker
In many of the service organizations that I'm involved in, I noticed that my peers often have trouble remembering the details of the events they've volunteered at and the organizations they've joined, making it difficult to complete end-of-year reports and other documents requiring the discussion of volunteer experience.

Created for the CS50x Final Project, Volunteer Tracker is a web-based application that serves three main purposes:
1. to help users record details about the service events that they have attended
2. to calculate the total number of hours volunteered
3. to keep track of the various organizations joined

After signing up for Volunteer Tracker, users have the ability to both add and delete events and organizations. In addition, they can view lists of all recorded events and organizations with more specific details, as well as change their password at any time.
